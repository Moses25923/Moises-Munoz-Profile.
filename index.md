My name is Moises Munoz, and I am a Senior at Northern Illinois University, majoring in Marketing with a certificate in Digital Marketing.

I am a Siberian Husky with striking blue eyes and beautiful black-and-white markings. My role includes boosting school spirit, entertaining crowds, and representing NIU at various events.

### Background

I'm a first generation student who is the youngest out of 5 whos parents immigrated from Mexico. They have showned me that hard work with help you accomplish your goals in life. Coming to NIU was a goal of mine to get an higher education which goes back to the struggles that my paretns went through.
